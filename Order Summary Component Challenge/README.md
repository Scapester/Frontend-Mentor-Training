## My process

Develop the HTML structure
Develop the CSS grid layout
Develop the CSS sub-grids
Insert and tweak the graphics
Tweak the layout to match the provided images

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid (and nested grids)

### What I learned

Primarily I learned more about CSS grids and how to resize SVG elements provided. The SVG banner was too big for the mobile card, so I used a viewbox in conjunction with the height and width properties. 

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/) - I really like this site and the CSS grid guide is a great visual reference for grid properties. I also used their SVG resizing article.
- [Resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - I love this site and its easy to use reference. Although some of the material assumes a level of knowledge that some may not have.
